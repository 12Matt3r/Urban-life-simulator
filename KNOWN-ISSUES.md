# Known Issues

- iOS autoplay policy: audio requires a user gesture before playback. We show an “Enable Audio” button when needed.
- Narrative generator: local mock by default; WebSim narrator (`?engine=websim`) requires network access and may time out (handled with fallback).
- Community uploads: UI wired; full cloud moderation not implemented.
- Multiplayer: deferred (single-player first).
