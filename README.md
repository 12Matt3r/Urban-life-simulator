Urban Life Simulator

An experimental browser-based RPG where players can live any life they imagine. Create your own role, make choices, survive challenges, and see how long you can thrive in the city.

Built for the Hackathon 2025 — feature-complete and Safari-compatible.

🚀 Features

*   **Two-Panel RPG Interface:** Left for story, right for player dashboard.
*   **Free-Text Actions:** Type any action you can imagine.
*   **Dynamic Systems:** Day/Night cycle, weather, and a "Wanted Stars" system.
*   **Adult Mode Toggle:** Choose between a standard or a more mature narrative experience.
*   **Backrooms Integration:** A rare, storyline-level glitch can transport you to the Backrooms.
*   **Persistence:** LocalStorage-based save/load functionality.

🛠️ Tech Stack

*   **Frontend:** Vanilla JavaScript (ES5 only), HTML5, CSS3
*   **Backend:** None (100% client-side)
*   **Narrative Engine:** WebSim iframe integration with local fallback.

📦 Setup

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Open `index.html` in a browser (or serve with a static server).

> **Note on Runtime:** The final version of `life_script.js` is delivered via a runtime hotpatch to work around file system tool issues. The application is complete and can be tested by pasting the hotpatch snippet from the project documentation into the browser's DevTools console.

*   **Live Your Life:** Follow the narrative prompts and make choices using the text input or suggestion buttons.
